I am a postdoctoral researcher in Computer Science, with a focus on Artificial Intelligence (AI). My work centers on evaluating the environmental impact of machine learning systems. During my Ph.D. at the STMS laboratory (Ircam), I studied the energy consumption of neural networks applied to audio generation. I then extended this research during my postdoc at LORIA (Inria Nancy), focusing on sound event detection. I am currently a postdoc in the Qaram team at the LIS laboratory (Aix-Marseille University), where I continue to explore the environmental implications of AI technologies.
